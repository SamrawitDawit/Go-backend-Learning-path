# API Documentation

## Overview
This API provides endpoints to manage tasks, including retrieving, adding, updating and deleting tasks. The API now provides basic user management services like registeration, login and promotion from regular user to an admin.It uses JWT authentication to secure endpoints.

## Authentication And Authorization

### JWT Authentication 
The API uses JSON Web Tokens(JWT) for authenticatio. After a user logs in, they receive a JWT which must be included in the `Authorization` header for accessing protected endpoints.

Header format:
```makefile
Authorization: Bearer<token>
```
### Roles
  - User: A regular user with access to retrieve tasks either by their ID or the whole tasks in the database.
  - Admin: An elevated role that allows additional capabilities, such as promoting other users to admin, creating, updating and deleting tasks.
  
  ** If the database is empty, the first created user will be an admin, otherwise a user's role is regular by default unless it's promoted.

## MongoDB Configuration
To connect the GO application to MongoDB, you need to congigure the MongoDB connection string. This can be done through environment variables or configuration file.

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables
```export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
   export MONGODB_DATABASE="taskdb"
```


### Configuration File
Alternatively, you can use a configuration file to store the MonoDB connection settings.
eg. `config.json`
```{
  "mongodb_uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
  "mongodb_database": "taskmanager"
}
```
## MongoDB Connection Setup
The following steps describe how to establish a connection to MongoDB Go driver.

### Step 1: Install the MongoDB Go Driver
`go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo`

### Step 2: Connect to MongoDB
```go
clientOptions := options.Client().ApplyURI(mongodb://localhost:27017)
client, err := mongo.Connect(context.TODO(), clientOptions)
if err != nil{
  log.Fatal(err)
}
db := client.Database("taskdb")
tasksCollection := db.Collection("tasks")
userCollection := db.Collection("users")
```

### Step 3: Handle Database Operations 
For CRUD operations, use the `taskCollection` to perform operations on the task collection.

## Database Structure
Tasks are stored in the `tasks` collection within the specified MongoDB database. Each task document has the following structure
```json
{
  "_id": "<ObjectId>",
  "title": "Task title",
  "description": "Task description",
  "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "status": "Not Started/Completed/etc."
}
```
